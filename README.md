Gotthelf-Ediarum, scholars can create and edit TEI-XML based transcriptions of historical
documents for the "Digitale Historisch-kritische Gesamtausgabe der Werke und Briefe von Jeremias Gotthelf" (dHKG).
The transcriptions can e.g. be enriched with text and links to an index or data of GND ("Gemeinsame Normdatei").
